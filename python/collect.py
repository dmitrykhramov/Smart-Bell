	This function is to collect encoding face data.
	we detects face in the frame and check whether the frame is enough to detect face or not.

	If enough, we would save the frame as '.jpg' and load the image which is saved as '.jpg'.
	If you encode immediately the frame, it would make incorrect encoding data, because the frame is different format with '.jpg'.
	And we associates visitor's id with the encoding data. When you want to delete visitor, you would use visitor's id. That's why we associates visitor's id with encoding data of the visitor.
	Then, we save the associated data.
	If it's first time to dump, just dump it.
	If not, load 'faces_encodings.txt', append it to registered data, then dump.
